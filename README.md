Image encryption using 3D Logistic Map and Improved Chirikov Map

## Abstract: 
Images are one of the essential data being generated daily. Many images are taken in our day-to-day life. It is vital to keep those images secure. This paper proposes a new image encryption algorithm utilizing a 3D Logistic Map and an improved Chirikov Map. There have been several suggested image encryption techniques using chaotic maps. Some of these are time expensive and sophisticated, while others have limited key space. A nonlinear 3D Logistic Map performs better in terms of randomization attributes and security measures. With the modification in the Chirikov Map from the standard map adds more robustness to the algorithm by producing a cipher image which is a more secure and random image compared with the plain-text image. This paper performed well-known cryptographic tests to assess the security and performance analysis of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is resistant to brute force attacks and differential cryptanalysis. The algorithm is susceptible, even to a slight change in the secret key.
